    <h1>My Favorite Hip-Hop Albums of the 2020s!</h1>
    <p>I love hip-hop so much. It's hard to explain but the genre is such a vast mental playground for music nerds like me. Also, you better agree with my list (though this is more of favorites list rather than what I think are the best).</p>

        <p>Far from a perfect album but the highs are just so high. This is my go-to record to spin on the turntable on
          rainy days. "Walkin'" is my favorite song off this project. Very soulful album for a rapper known for their aggressive style. Beautiful album with heavy introspective elements.</p><hr>

        <h2>Chromakopia - Tyler, The Creator</h2>

        <p>Chromakopia holds a lot of sentimental value for me. The most introspective project of one of this generation's
          most polarizing rap artists. "Darling, I" is one of my favorite songs of all time. Also got to attend the Chromakopia tour! Overall a very meaningful album.</p><hr>

        <h2>SCARING THE HOES - JPEGMAFIA & Danny Brown</h2>

        <p>Absolute weirdo neurodivergent energy bouncing back and forth between Peggy and Danny. I have no clue what
          they're saying on this album, but damn the beats are unmatched. The sampling on this one isn't talked about enough. Hard to listen to this album without at least standing up.</p><hr>

        <h2>Let God Sort Em Out - Clipse</h2>

        <p>The first album I have ever listened to the first minute after its release. Their rapping styles are so simple
          compared to a lot of rappers today yet they hold on to your attention like insane. Of course, we can't talk about
          LGSEO without praising Pharrell's stupidly killer production.</p><hr>

        <h2>The Forever Story - JID</h2>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forever_Story">

        <p>My favorite album, at least for the 2020s. Such a heavy, substantial project that does not get the recognition it
          deserves outside of its hit single "Surround Sound," but understandably so because that song is a banger. Super dense even for an project with a playtime of just above 1 hour. JID raps (and sings) like crazy.
